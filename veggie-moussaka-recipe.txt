Ingredients:
- 140g dried green lentil
- 2 onions, halved and sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, chopped
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- ½ tsp cinnamon
- ½ tsp allspice
- 400g can chopped tomato
- 1 reduced-salt vegetable stock cube
- 200g sweet potato, thinly sliced
- 1 large aubergine, sliced and the biggest slices halved again
- 250g low-fat fromage frais
- 1 large egg
- 50g feta cheese, crumbled
- 4 tomatoes, thickly sliced

Directions:
1. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the lentils, onions, garlic, herbs and
spices in a large pan, and pour in 850ml water. Bring to the boil, cover and
simmer for 10 mins.
2. Tip in the tomatoes, stock cube, sweet potato and aubergine, then cover and
simmer for a further 20-25 mins until the lentils and veg are tender, and the
liquid has been absorbed. Remove the bay leaves.
3. Meanwhile, beat the fromage frais, egg and cheese together. Tip the lentil
mixture into a large ovenproof dish, cover with the cheese mixture, then arrange
the tomatoes on top. Grind over some black pepper and bake for 25 mins until the
topping is set. Will keep for 3 days in the fridge.
